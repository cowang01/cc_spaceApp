    <h1>Black Holes</h1>
  </header>

  <p>A black hole is a region of space from which nothing, including light,
    can escape. According to the general theory of relativity,
    it is the result of the curving of spacetime caused by a huge mass.
    Around a black hole there is a position of no return,
    called the event horizon.</p>


    <p>Stellar black holes form when the centre of a very massive star
      collapses in upon itself. This collapse also causes a supernova,
      or an exploding star, that blasts part of the star into space.</p>

        If you happened to fly near a black hole, its extreme gravitational
        pull would increasingly slow down time and warp space.
        You'd be tugged ever closer, spiraling inward
        toward the event horizon or "point of no return." Once you crossed this
        boundary, you would plunge toward the singularity at the black
        hole's center — an inconceivably small point with a monstrous mass where gravity and density theoretically approach
         infinity and space-time curves infinitely. In other words,
         you'd be gobbled up and annihilated in a place that utterly defies
         the laws of physics as we understand them.

      The closest black hole we know of is V616 Monocerotis, also known
      as V616 Mon. It's located about 3,000 light years away, which means
      even if it was travelling towards us at the speed of light, it would
      take 3000 years to reach us. It has between 9-13 times the mass of our
      Sun. Black holes are hard to locate as they don't emit light but we know
      V616 Monocerotis is there because it's located in a binary system with
      a star with about half the mass of the Sun.

<div class="black_hole_centre">The Milky Way galaxy alone is thought to
  harbor some 100 million stellar-mass black holes. At the centre of the Milky
  Way there is a supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A*. at its heart.With 100 billion galaxies
  out there, each with 100 million stellar-mass black holes and a core
  supermassive monster (not to mention other types
  being discovered), it's like trying to count grains of sand.</div>
